Readme for transient heat conduction matlab code.

Code takes different inputs for temperatures at various points. It uses discretized governing equations for the transient 
heat conduction quenching problem. This takes T as a function of (x,t) as T=T(x,t). There are different temperatures at 
different x locations throughout the piece. The thermal conductivity, k, has been set for inconel, a type of high temp
titanium. 

The output is Temperature versus time.
